          I had the opportunity to do my 4th year internship in the cybersecurity research lab of ESIEA. During my mission, I updated and added new functionalities to PassiveDNS.
          PassiveDNS is an open source domain name monitoring web app.

          I learnt to use Docker and Github actions to make a continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) app.

          I worked independently on every part of the application on a Model/View/Controller base:
          - The front (Vue JS3, Javascript, HTML, CSS)
          - The web server (Python, FastAPI)
          - The database (ArangoDB, graph-oriented)

          I teamed up with 5 other students at ESIEA for our 4th year technical project.
          The goal of this exercise was to make us think about a project that would work toward one of the [17 sustainable development goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/).
          After some research and interviews, we decided to create a mobile app that would help raise awareness among hospital staff about digital security. 
          
          With this project, I learnt to:
          - Use the agile method and planning to create and build a project with a team from scratch
          - Analyse the needs for a products of the people involved
          - Use Figma and FlutterFlow to develop a mobile app

          In 3rd year we have a special project to work on, which does not involves technical aspects, but human ones.
          I was project manager of a team of 6 people, and we created an exhibition to raise awareness on the differents groups of disabilities and how to help be more inclusive.
